# IS_puredata_work

## By Nestor Ortiz

This repository contains a Python-based implementation that captures data from a camera and transmits it over the network.
The data is received in Pure Data, where the brightness and color values are used to generate a rhythmic pattern based on the brightness levels.

Additionally, the camera feed is divided into 16 regions, and the average red color intensity across these sections is used to control the speed of the rhythm, creating a dynamic audiovisual interaction.
